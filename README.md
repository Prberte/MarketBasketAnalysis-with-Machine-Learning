## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is a popular technique used by retailers to identify associations between different items that customers purchase together. This analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions, such as product placement, promotions, and inventory management.

In this project, we employ various machine learning algorithms to perform Market Basket Analysis, including association rule mining and clustering. The project is designed to be modular and extendable, making it easy to adapt to different datasets and use cases.

## Features

- **Association Rule Mining**: Discover relationships between items using algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth.
- **Clustering**: Group similar transactions or customers to better understand buying patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations to interpret the results of the analysis.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large datasets with efficient algorithms.
- **Customizability**: Easily adaptable to different datasets and analysis requirements.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook (for running notebooks)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prberte/MarketBasketAnalysis-with-Machine-Learning.git
   cd MarketBasketAnalysis-with-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the provided notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

The project includes multiple Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of Market Basket Analysis. You can modify these notebooks to suit your own data or use them as templates for new analyses.

1. **Data Preparation**: Load your transactional data into the appropriate format. The project assumes that the data is structured with transactions and items, but can be adapted to different formats.
  
2. **Association Rule Mining**: Run algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

3. **Clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to group similar transactions or customers.

4. **Visualization**: Use the provided functions to create charts and graphs that illustrate your findings.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the types of insights you can gain from this project:

- **Frequent Itemsets**: Identify the most commonly purchased items together.
- **Association Rules**: Discover patterns like "If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter."
- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
